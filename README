How to setup openprinting site and database from bazaar branch
==============================================================

1) Copy the whole contents of the site branch to a folder where it is going to be located
I.e.,

  # cp printing-new/* /srv/www/openprinting/

2) Create "inc/siteconf.php" configuration file for the site. You can use siteconf-DEV.php or siteconf-PROD.php as a basis.
In that file you should set access parameters for the MySQL database, LDAP server, mail addresses and some other settings.

3) Edit the "build" script - set BASEDIR variable at the top of the script to the actual directory where the site is located

4) Launch the build script:

  # ./build

Note that this script uses inc/siteconf.php to create mysql.conf file for foomatic.

5) If you want to create openprinting database from scratch, launch setupdb.sh script from the maint/scripts folder:

  # cd maint/scripts
  # ./setupdb.sh


Note that setupdb.sh uses inc/siteconf.php to get database access parameters.

======
That's all. Now you should be able to access your copy of the openprinting site.
