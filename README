How to setup openprinting site and database from bazaar branch
==============================================================

1) Copy the whole contents of the site branch to a folder where it is going to be located
I.e.,

  # cp printing-new/* /srv/www/openprinting/

2) Create "inc/siteconf.php" configuration file for the site. You can use siteconf-DEV.php or siteconf-PROD.php as a basis.
In that file you should set access parameters for the MySQL database, LDAP server, mail addresses and some other settings.

3) Edit the "build" script - set BASEDIR variable at the top of the script to the actual directory where the site is located

4) Launch the build script:

  # ./build

Note that this script uses inc/siteconf.php to create mysql.conf file for foomatic.

5) If you want to create openprinting database from scratch, launch setupdb.sh script from the maint/scripts folder:

  # cd maint/scripts
  # ./setupdb.sh


Note that setupdb.sh uses inc/siteconf.php to get database access parameters.

6) Now you can populate the databse using the data from bzr using "importfrombzr" script
which tries to parse printer xml files and load them to the database.
Let's try to import everything from foomatic-db and foomatic-db-nonfree:

  # export WORKDIR=/srv/www/openprinting/foomatic
  # cd $WORKDIR
  # bzr branch http://bzr.linuxfoundation.org/openprinting/foomatic/foomatic-db
  # bzr branch http://bzr.linuxfoundation.org/openprinting/foomatic/foomatic-db-nonfree
  # cd ..

  # revno=`cd $WORKDIR/foomatic-db && bzr revno`
  # maint/scripts/importfrombzr $WORKDIR/foomatic-db 1 $revno

  # revno=`cd $WORKDIR/foomatic-db-nonfree && bzr revno`
  # maint/scripts/importfrombzr $WORKDIR/foomatic-db-nonfree 1 $revno


======
That's all. Now you should be able to access your copy of the openprinting site.
